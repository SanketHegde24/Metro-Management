# Metro-Management
Project Description:
The Metro Management System is a web-based platform designed to enhance the user experience of metro commuters. The system is divided into two main components: User Interface and Admin Panel.

User Interface:

Ticket Purchase: Users can register or log in to the system to purchase metro tickets. They provide relevant information such as the source and destination stations, travel date and time, and preferred ticket type (single journey, round trip, etc.).

Complaints and Feedback: Users can submit complaints or provide feedback regarding their experience with the metro service. This information is stored and can be used for service improvement.

Admin Panel:

User Management: Admins have the authority to add new users to the system, delete existing users, and update user information.

Feedback Analysis: The admin panel provides insights into user feedback and complaints, aiding in making data-driven decisions for service enhancement.

Website Management: Admins can update or delete content on the website, ensuring that information provided to users is accurate and up-to-date.

Technology Stack:

Django: The core framework that powers the application, providing a robust structure and seamless integration between different components.
HTML and CSS: Used to design and style the user interface, ensuring an intuitive and visually appealing experience.
MySQL: The database management system chosen to store user information, ticket data, and feedback.
Impact:
The Metro Management System aims to streamline the ticketing process, enhance user satisfaction, and facilitate efficient administrative control. By providing a user-friendly interface and enabling quick access to ticketing and feedback submission, the system contributes to a smoother commuting experience.
